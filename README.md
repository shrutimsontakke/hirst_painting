# Hirst Painting with Python Turtle

This Python project is a programmatic recreation of artist Damien Hirst's dot paintings. Using Python's Turtle module, the script generates a grid of colored dots based on a predefined list of RGB color values.

## Project Description

This project uses Python's Turtle graphics library to create a visual pattern inspired by the famous "Spot Paintings" of Damien Hirst. The program arranges colored dots in a grid format, with each dot being randomly assigned a color from a hardcoded list of RGB values.

### Features

- Turtle Graphics: Utilizes Turtle to draw dots of different colors in a grid format.
- Randomized Colors: The color of each dot is chosen randomly from a predefined color list, giving a unique and vibrant look to each painting.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Turtle Graphics (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory and run:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. A Turtle graphics window will open, and the program will automatically start drawing the painting.
4. The Turtle window will close once you click anywhere inside it.

## Explanation of Code

1. **Setting up Turtle**: The turtle is configured to be fast, with the pen up and hidden from view for quicker, cleaner drawing.
  
2. **Drawing Dots**: The turtle moves to a specific starting point and then starts drawing dots in a grid. Each dot is randomly assigned a color from the list, creating a colorful pattern. After each row, the turtle moves up to the next row.

## Additional Information

This project is inspired by Damien Hirst's dot paintings and demonstrates the basics of Turtle graphics and color manipulation in Python. It is an engaging way to explore Pythonâ€™s Turtle library and experiment with simple, programmatic art.
